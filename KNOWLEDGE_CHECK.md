# Lab 07: Knowledge check

**Answer each question below it, in your own words, in one to three sentences.** Replace the `...` below **Your answer:** with your text. Questions 1 to 3 also ask for a screenshot, which goes into the folder `results/`.

Questions 1 to 3 describe **hypothetical** problems: they may not have happened to you, but they are common, and you should know where to look when they do.

## 1. EC2: why can't I log in with `ssh`?

Suppose your instance is running and has a public IP address, but `ssh` cannot connect. A common cause is the instance's security group: a firewall that decides which connections reach the instance.

**Your task:** find the place in the AWS Console that shows which connections your instance's security group lets in. Take a screenshot of it and save it as `results/security-group.png`. (The security group is still there after you terminated the instance.)

*Hint:* the lecture slides, and [class/07-ec2](https://github.com/ksiller/DS2022/blob/main/class/07-ec2/README.md), part [3. Launch an EC2 instance in the AWS Console + SSH](https://github.com/ksiller/DS2022/blob/main/class/07-ec2/README.md#3-launch-an-ec2-instance-in-the-aws-console--ssh-15-min) and [Troubleshooting](https://github.com/ksiller/DS2022/blob/main/class/07-ec2/README.md#troubleshooting).

**Your answer:** Which path did you take in the console (service → page → tab)?

I first searched for and clicked on EC2. Then on the side dash I went to the Network & Security tab then clicked on Security Groups.
I then clicked on the one called launch-wizard-1 which showed me the one with port range of 22 that allowed ssh.

## 2. Lambda: why didn't my function run?

Suppose you uploaded a new book to your bucket, but several minutes later MongoDB still has no document for it. Maybe the function never started, because its trigger is missing or wrong.

**Your task:** find the place in the AWS Console that shows what starts your Lambda function. Take a screenshot of it and save it as `results/lambda-trigger.png`.

*Hint:* the class demo [A Lambda function in the AWS Console](https://github.com/ksiller/DS2022/blob/main/demos/07-lambda/README.md), steps [5. Add the S3 trigger](https://github.com/ksiller/DS2022/blob/main/demos/07-lambda/README.md#5-add-the-s3-trigger) and [8. Preview: the same steps with Chalice](https://github.com/ksiller/DS2022/blob/main/demos/07-lambda/README.md#8-preview-the-same-steps-with-chalice).

**Your answer:** Which path did you take in the console (service → page → tab)?

I searched for and clicked on Lambda which brought me to event functions and book-analyzer-dev-analyze_new_book. 
I clicked on Configuration then clicked on Triggers. This showed me the S3 bucket.

## 3. Lambda: where do I find the error?

Suppose the function did start, but MongoDB still has no document for the book. Then the function failed while it ran, and its error message is in its log.

**Your task:** find the place in the AWS Console where your Lambda function's log is, and open the log of the run for `pg74.txt`. Take a screenshot that shows the line `pg74.txt: ... words`, and save it as `results/lambda-cloudwatch-log.png`.

*Hint:* [Part 2, Step 7](README.md#step-7-upload-a-new-book) in the README, and the class demo [A Lambda function in the AWS Console](https://github.com/ksiller/DS2022/blob/main/demos/07-lambda/README.md), step [7. Check the CloudWatch logs](https://github.com/ksiller/DS2022/blob/main/demos/07-lambda/README.md#7-check-the-cloudwatch-logs).

**Your answer:** Which path did you take in the console (service → page → tab)?

I searched for and clicked on Lambda which brought me to event functions and book-analyzer-dev-analyze_new_book. It landed on Monitor
page where I then click on View CloudWatch logs, where I look for Log Streams and click on the most recent one. I found the line that
stated how many words the book has.

## 4. EC2 or Lambda: a backlog or new uploads?

Which would you use, EC2 or Lambda, in each of these two cases? Explain each choice in one or two sentences.

- **Case A, a backlog:** a library gives you 5,000 more books. They are already in your bucket, and you need to analyze them once.
- **Case B, new uploads:** readers upload new books at random times, a few each day. Each book should be analyzed within a minute after its upload.

For comparison, typical times in this lab:

- **EC2** (`t3.micro`): about 20 seconds for all 100 books, plus a few minutes to start the instance and run the bootstrap. The instance costs money for every minute it runs, also while it waits.
- **Lambda** (512 MB): about 2 seconds for one book, including about 1 second to start the function the first time (a cold start). The function runs, and costs, only while a book is analyzed.

**Your answer:**

For Case A, I would pick EC2 because it would take a little over 1000 seconds compared to a little over 10000 seconds comparatively. 
It would probably cost less too because it is charged by the minute rather than the book, and you know it be done only once.

For Case B, I would pick Lambda because it is quicker for this scenario and it needed to have a quick start to be analyzed in a minute.
This time you also don't know when the book will come so this would be more flexible cost and time wise.
